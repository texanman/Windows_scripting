--WIP--


Orginally this was created to assist with our local helpdesk. This script can be modifed in anyway your group or use sees fit and is more for an example. Copy everything in this folder to a local machine location then run the SETUP.bat script. This generates a configuration file in the local user's my documents folder called macro_config.ini. This ini file can contain any static variables you would like to setup for personal use such as your username, phone numbers, etc. This config file also sets up custom options such as the example clipboard manager and custom triggers.

Once the config ini is created you can then run the "macro script.ahk". This will be the main script that will launch the main menu and other submenus. With this example do not run the ahk scripts in the other folders as the main script calls all these subscripts.
